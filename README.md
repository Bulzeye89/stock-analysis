# Stock Analysis with Excel and VBA
## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background

Using the stock data from Steve [(download here)](https://github.com/Bulzeye89/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) for 12 stocks for the years of 2017 and 2018, I was able to create a VBA script while working through module 2.  The macro from this VBA script allowed Steve, with a click of a button, to easily analyze the performance of the 12 stocks in the research for his parents.  This analysis can be seen below.

He has now inquired if we can expand the data set to include the entire stock market over the last few years.  While our original code ran fairly quickly, with such a larger data set, the code could get bogged down.  Our first step in accomplishing this goal for him is to dive back into our code and refactor it so that it can run more efficiently.
